McGregor of Winnetka , Ill. , in one of the 92 letters the agency has received since the changes were proposed Aug. 17 <start> `` Apparently the commission did not really believe in this ideal <start> '' Currently , the rules force executives , directors and other corporate insiders to report purchases and sales of their companies ' shares within about a month after the transaction <start> But about 25 % of the insiders , according to SEC figures , file their reports late <start> The changes were proposed in an effort to streamline federal bureaucracy and boost compliance by the executives `` who are really calling the shots , '' said Brian Lane , special counsel at the SEC 's office of disclosure policy , which proposed the changes <start> Investors , money managers and corporate officials had until today to comment on the proposals , and the issue has produced more mail than almost any other issue in memory , Mr. Lane said <start> The SEC will probably vote on the proposal early next year , he said <start> Not all those who wrote oppose the changes <start> The Committee on Federal Regulation of Securities for the American Bar Association argues , for example , in its lengthy letter to the SEC , that the proposed changes `` would substantially improve the { law } by conforming it more closely to contemporary business realities <start> '' What the investors who oppose the proposed changes object to most is the effect they say the proposal would have on their ability to spot telltale `` clusters '' of trading activity -- buying or selling by more than one officer or director within a short period of time <start> According to some estimates , the rule changes would cut insider filings by more than a third <start> The SEC 's Mr. Lane vehemently disputed those estimates <start> The rules will eliminate filings policy-making divisions , such as sales , marketing , finance and research and development , Mr. Lane said <start> The proposed rules also would be tougher on the insiders still required to file reports , he said <start> Companies would be compelled to publish in annual proxy statements the names of insiders who fail to file reports on time <start> Considered as a whole , Mr. Lane said , the filings required under the proposed rules `` will be at least as effective , if not more so , for investors following transactions <start> '' But Robert Gabele , president of Invest\\/Net , a North Miami , Fla. , company that packages and sells the insider-trading data , said the proposal is worded so vaguely that key officials may fail to file the reports <start> Many investors wrote asking the SEC to require insiders to report their purchases and sales immediately , not a month later <start> But Mr. Lane said that while the SEC regulates who files , the law tells them when to do so <start> Investors who want to change the required timing should write their representatives in Congress , he added <start> The SEC would likely

Commission approval <start> For its employees to sign up for the options , a college also must approve the plan <start> Some 4,300 institutions are part of the pension fund <start> The new options carry out part of an agreement that the pension fund , under pressure to relax its strict participation rules and to provide more investment options , reached with the SEC in December <start> The new `` social choice '' fund will shun securities of companies linked to South Africa , nuclear power and in some cases , Northern Ireland <start> Also excluded will be investments in companies with ``

Ed Tyler , 37 years old , a senior vice president at this printing concern , was elected president of its technology group , a new position <start> <start> Solo woodwind players have to be creative if they want to work a lot , because their repertoire and audience appeal are limited <start> The oboist Heinz Holliger has taken a hard line about the problem : He commissions and splendidly interprets fearsome contemporary scores and does some conducting , so he does n't have to play the same Mozart and Strauss concertos over and over again <start> Richard Stoltzman has taken a gentler , more audience-friendly approach <start> Years ago , he collaborated with the new music gurus Peter Serkin and Fred Sherry in the very countercultural chamber group Tashi , which won audiences over to dreaded contemporary scores like Messiaen 's `` Quartet for the End of Time <start> '' Today , the pixie-like clarinetist has mostly dropped the missionary work ( though a touch of the old Tashi still survives ) and now goes on the road with piano , bass , a slide show , and a repertoire that ranges from light classical to light jazz to light pop , with a few notable exceptions <start> Just the thing for the Vivaldi-at-brunch set , the yuppie audience that has embraced New Age as its very own easy listening <start> But you ca n't dismiss Mr. Stoltzman 's music or his motives as merely commercial and lightweight <start> He believes in what he plays , and he plays superbly <start> His recent appearance at the Metropolitan Museum , dubbed `` A Musical Odyssey , '' was a case in point <start> It felt more like a party , or a highly polished jam session with a few friends , than a classical concert <start> Clad in his trademark black velvet suit , the soft-spoken clarinetist announced that his new album , `` Inner Voices , '' had just been released , that his family was in the front row , and that it was his mother 's birthday , so he was going to play her favorite tune from the record <start> He launched into Saint-Saens 's `` The Swan '' from `` Carnival of the Animals , '' a favorite encore piece for cellists , with lovely , glossy tone and no bite <start> Then , as if to show that he could play fast as well , he offered the second movement from Saint-Saens 's Sonata for Clarinet , a whimsical , puckish tidbit that reflected the flip side of the Stoltzman personality <start> And so it went through the first half : an ingeniously chosen potpourri of pieces , none longer than five minutes , none that would disturb or challenge a listener <start> Mr. Stoltzman introduced his colleagues : Bill Douglas , pianist\\/bassoonist\\/composer and an old buddy from Yale , and jazz bassist Eddie Gomez <start> An improvisational section was built around pieces by Mr. Douglas , beginning with `` Golden Rain , '' a lilting , laid-back lead in to the uptempo `` Sky , '' which gave Mr. Stoltzman the opportunity to wail in a high register and show off his fleet fingers <start> Bach 's `` Air '' followed <start> Mr. Stoltzman tied the composer in by proclaiming him `` the great improviser of the 18th century , '' and then built on the image by joining with Mr. Douglas in some Bach two-part inventions , cleverly arranged for clarinet and bassoon by Mr. Douglas <start> Keeping the mood light , the two then chanted and chortled their way through some murderous polyrhythms , devised by Mr. Douglas as an alternative to Hindemith 's dry theory-teaching techniques , and then , with Mr. Gomez , soared and improvised on the composer 's tight `` Bebop Etudes <start> '' The end of the first half , however , brought what the standing-room-only crowd seemed to be waiting for : the pop singer Judy Collins , who appears on `` Inner Voices <start> '' Glamorous and pure-voiced as ever , Ms. Collins sang Joni Mitchell 's `` For Free '' -- about an encounter with a street-corner clarinetist , to which Mr. Stoltzman contributed a clarinet obligatto -- and Mr. Douglas 's lush setting of a Gaelic blessing , `` Deep Peace <start> '' `` Deep Peace '' also featured a slide show of lovely but predictable images of clouds , beaches , deserts , sunsets , etc <start> It was all too mellow to be believed , but they probably would have gotten away with it , had they not felt compelled to add Ms. Collins 's signature tune , `` Amazing Grace , '' and ask for audience participation <start> That went over the permissible line for warm and fuzzy feelings <start> Was this why some of the audience departed before or during the second half ? Or was it because Ms. Collins had gone ? Either way it was a pity , because Mr. Stolzman offered the most substantial music of the evening just after intermission : Steve Reich 's `` New York Counterpoint , '' one of a series of Reich works that juxtapose a live performer with recorded tracks of his or her own playing <start> ( Mr. Reich 's new `` Different Trains '' for string quartet uses the technique magisterially <start> ) Mr. Stoltzman must have worried that his audience might not be able to take it : He warned us in advance that `` New York Counterpoint '' lasts 11 1\\/2 minutes <start> He also unfortunately illustrated this intricate , jazzy tapestry with Mr. Pearson 's images , this time of geometric or repeating objects , in a kitschy mirroring of the musical structure that was thoroughly distracting from Mr. Reich 's piece and Mr. Stoltzman 's elegant execution of it <start> The rest of the concert was more straight jazz and mellow sounds written by Charlie Parker , Ornette Coleman , Bill Douglas and Eddie Gomez , with pictures for the Douglas pieces <start> It was enjoyable to hear accomplished jazz without having to sit in a smoke-filled club , but like the first half , much of it was easy to take and ultimately forgettable <start> Is this the future of chamber music ? Managers and presenters insist that chamber music concerts are a hard sell , but can audiences really enjoy them only if the music is purged of threatening elements , served up in bite-sized morsels and accompanied by visuals ? What 's next ? Slides to illustrate Shostakovich quartets ? It was not an unpleasant evening , certainly , thanks to the high level of performance , the compositional talents of Mr. Douglas , and the obvious sincerity with which Mr. Stoltzman chooses his selections <start> But it was neither deep nor lasting : light entertainment that was no substitute for an evening of Brahms <start> Ms. Waleson is a free-lance writer based in New York <start> <start> One of Ronald Reagan 's attributes as President was that he rarely gave his blessing to the claptrap that passes for `` consensus '' in various international institutions <start> In fact , he liberated the U.S. from one of the world 's most corrupt organizations -- UNESCO <start> This is the U.N. group that managed to traduce its own charter of promoting education , science and culture <start> Ever since , the remaining members have been desperate for the United States to rejoin this dreadful group <start> Now UNESCO apologists are lobbying President Bush to renege on President Reagan 's decision to depart <start> But we can think of many reasons to stay out for the foreseeable future and well beyond <start> The U.S. , along with Britain and Singapore , left the agency when its anti-Western ideology , financial corruption and top leadership got out of hand <start> The personal antics of agency Director Amadou-Mahtar M'Bow drew much attention , such as when several of his top aides were uncovered as KGB plants and ejected from France and when a mysterious office fire was set just before Congress sent accountants to trace U.S. funds <start> Mr. M'Bow was an extreme case , but even his replacement , the more personally genial Spanish biochemist Federico Mayor , has had little success at achieving reforms <start> Several ridiculous projects continue , including the `` New International Economic Order , '' which means redistributionism from the West to pay for everyone else 's statism <start> The Orwellian `` New World Information Order '' would give government officials rights against the press ; journalists would be obliged to kowtow to their government , which would have licensing and censorship powers and , indeed , duties to block printing of `` wrong '' ideas <start> UNESCO somehow converted the founding U.N. ideals of individual rights and liberty into `` peoples ' rights <start> '' Million-dollar conferences were held to chew on subjects such as `` ethical responsibilities of scientists in support of disarmament '' and `` the impact of the activities of transnational corporations <start> '' The agency was so totally subverted from the high principles of its founding that even the Soviets now wonder about an agency that seemed so congenial to them <start> Glasnost may be partly responsible , but Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze last year admitted , `` The exaggerated ideological approach undermined tolerance intrinsic to UNESCO <start> '' UNESCO is now holding its biennial meetings in Paris to devise its next projects <start> Mr. Mayor 's hope that references to `` press freedom '' would survive unamended seems doomed to failure ; the current phrasing is `` educating the public and media to avoid manipulation <start> '' He has n't been able to replace the M'Bow cabal <start> Soviets remain in charge of education programs , a former head of an African military tribunal for executions is in charge of culture , and a hard-line Polish communist in exile directs the human-rights and peace division <start> Of the agency 's 2,750 staff members , 230 are in the field working on actual projects , such as literacy and oceanographic research <start> The position of the United States , which once contributed 25 % of the budget , is that nothing has changed <start> John Bolton , the assistant secretary of state for international organizations , told Congress that the continuing `` statist , restrictive , nondemocratic '' programs make rejoining any time soon `` extremely unlikely <start> '' This has n't much bothered the UNESCO delegates , who last week could n't even agree to raise funds by selling off a fancy 19th-century French chateau the agency somehow owns <start> Other countries , including West Germany , may have a hard time justifying continued membership <start> We see an even stronger argument against UNESCO than its unsurprising failure to reform <start> This is that the Reagan Revolution spanning Eastern Europe and Tiananmen Square shows the power of ideas unencumbered by international civil servants or government functionaries <start> Free markets , free minds and free elections have an appeal that seems to get muddled only when delivered through U.N. organizations -- which of course are made up largely of governments that fear these principles at home <start> The Babelists of the United Nations are experts at obfuscation <start> This can have its purposes at times , but there 's no reason to cloud the importance and allure of Western concepts of freedom and justice <start> We can see plenty of reasons to stay out , and none to rejoin UNESCO <start> <start> Researchers at Plant Genetic Systems N.V. in Belgium said they have developed a genetic engineering technique for creating hybrid plants for a number of key crops <start> The researchers said they have isolated a plant gene that prevents the production of pollen <start> The gene thus can prevent a plant from fertilizing itself <start> Such so-called male-sterile plants can then be fertilized by pollen from another strain of the plant , thereby producing hybrid seed <start> The new generation of plants will possess the flourishing , high-production trait known as `` hybrid vigor , '' similar to that now seen in hybrid corn <start> `` The development could have a dramatic effect on farm production , especially cotton , '' said Murray Robinson , president of Delta & Pine Land Co. , a Southwide Inc. subsidiary that is one of the largest cotton seed producers in the U.S <start> On a commercial scale , the sterilization of the pollen-producing male part has only been achieved in corn and sorghum feed grains <start> That 's because the male part , the tassel , and the female , the ear , are some distance apart on the corn plant <start> In a labor-intensive process , the seed companies cut off the tassels of each plant , making it male sterile <start> They sow a row of male-fertile plants nearby , which then pollinate the male-sterile plants <start> The first hybrid corn seeds produced using this mechanical approach were introduced in the 1930s and they yielded as much as 20 % more corn than naturally pollinated plants <start> The vast majority of the U.S. corn crop now is grown from hybrid seeds produced by seed companies <start> A similar technique is almost impossible to apply to other crops , such as cotton , soybeans and rice <start> The male part , the anthers of the plant , and the female , the pistils , of the same plant are within a fraction of an inch or even attached to each other <start> The anthers in these plants are difficult to clip off <start> In China , a great number of workers are engaged in pulling out the male organs of rice plants using tweezers , and one-third of rice produced in that country is grown from hybrid seeds <start> At Plant Genetic Systems , researchers have isolated a pollen-inhibiting gene that can be inserted in a plant to confer male sterility <start> Jan Leemans , research director , said this gene was successfully introduced in oil-producing rapeseed plants , a major crop in Europe and Canada , using as a carrier a `` promoter gene '' developed by Robert Goldberg at the University of California in Los Angeles <start> The sterilizing gene is expressed just before the pollen is about to develop and it deactivates the anthers of every flower in the plant <start> Mr. Leemans said this genetic manipulation does n't hurt the growth of that plant <start> The researchers also pulled off a second genetic engineering trick in order to get male-sterile plants in large enough numbers to produce a commercial hybrid seed crop <start> They attached a second gene , for herbicide resistance , to the pollen-inhibiting gene <start> Both genes are then inserted into a few greenhouse plants , which are then pollinated and allowed to mature and produce seed <start> The laws of heredity dictate that half of the plants springing from these greenhouse-produced seeds will be male sterile and herbicide resistant and half will be male fertile and herbicide susceptible <start> The application of herbicide would kill off the male-fertile plants , leaving a large field of male-sterile plants that can be cross-pollinated to produce hybrid seed <start> Mr. Leemans said the hybrid rapeseeds created with this genetic engineering yield 15 % to 30 % more output than the commercial strains used currently <start> `` This technique is applicable to a wide variety of crops , '' he said , and added that some modifications may be necessary to accommodate the peculiarities of each type of crop <start> He said the company is experimenting with the technique on alfalfa , and plans to include cotton and corn , among other crops <start> He said that even though virtually all corn seeds currently planted are hybrids , the genetic approach will obviate the need for mechanical emasculation of anthers , which costs U.S. seed producers about $ 70 million annually <start> In recent years , demand for hybrid seeds has spurred research at a number of chemical and biotechnology companies , including Monsanto Co. , Shell Oil Co. and Eli Lilly & Co <start> One technique developed by some of these companies involves a chemical spray supposed to kill only a plant 's pollen <start> But there have been problems with chemical sprays damaging plants ' female reproductive organs and concern for the toxicity of such chemical sprays to humans , animals and beneficial insects <start> However , Paul Johanson , Monsanto 's director of plant sciences , said the company 's chemical spray overcomes these problems and is `` gentle on the female organ <start> '' Biosource Genetics Corp. , Vacaville , Calif. , is developing a spray containing a gene that spreads from cell to cell and interferes with the genes that are responsible for producing pollen <start> This gene , called `` gametocide , '' is carried into the plant by a virus that remains active for a few days <start> Robert Erwin , president of Biosource , called Plant Genetic 's approach `` interesting '' and `` novel , '' and `` complementary rather than competitive <start> '' `` There is a large market out there hungry for hybrid seeds , '' he said <start> Mr. Robinson of Delta & Pine , the seed producer in Scott , Miss. , said Plant Genetic 's success in creating genetically engineered male steriles does n't automatically mean it would be simple to create hybrids in all crops <start> That 's because pollination , while easy in corn because the carrier is wind , is more complex and involves insects as carriers in crops such as cotton <start> `` It 's one thing to say you can sterilize , and another to then successfully pollinate the plant , '' he said <start> Nevertheless , he said , he is negotiating with Plant Genetic to acquire the technology to try breeding hybrid cotton <start> <start> A bitter conflict with global implications has erupted between Nomura Securities Co. and Industrial Bank of Japan , two of the world 's most powerful financial companies <start> The clash is a sign of a new toughness and divisiveness in Japan 's once-cozy financial circles <start> Not only are Japan 's financial institutions putting their enormous clout to work ; increasingly they 're squaring off against one another in unprecedented public fashion <start> Already , the consequences are being felt by other players in the financial markets -- even governments <start> What triggered the latest clash was a skirmish over the timing of a New Zealand government bond issue <start> Nomura was attempting to organize the 50 billion-yen ( $ 352 million ) borrowing in Japan at a time when many Japanese banks , led by Industrial Bank of Japan , were pressuring the Wellington government to help them recover loans made to a defunct investment bank that had been owned by New Zealand 's civil-service pension fund <start> Unwilling to put up new money for New Zealand until those debts are repaid , most banks refused even to play administrative roles in the new financing , forcing an embarrassed Nomura to postpone it this week <start> The dispute shows clearly the global power of Japan 's financial titans <start> Aside from Nomura 's injured pride , the biggest victim so far has been the New Zealand government <start> Barred by its budget law from making any new domestic bond issues , Wellington 's Debt Management Office had been casting abroad to raise the 3 billion New Zealand dollars ( US$ 1.76 billion ) to NZ$ 4 billion it needs to come up with by the end of its fiscal year next June 30 <start> With Japan 's cash-flush banks aligned against it , though , raising money may be difficult <start> Not only can they block Wellington from raising money in Japan , bankers here say , but as the largest underwriters in the Eurobond market , they might be able to scuttle borrowings there , too <start> New Zealand 's finance minister , David Caygill , lashed out at such suggestions <start> He told reporters in Wellington Tuesday that the government had n't guaranteed the loans to DFC New Zealand Ltd. , an investment bank 80%-owned by the National Provident Fund , and would n't bail it out <start> `` It may very well be what the Japanese banks want , '' he told Radio New Zealand <start> `` I think it would be irresponsible and I am not about to be blackmailed by Japanese banks or any other international interests <start> '' No less significant than the Japanese banks ' attempt to cut off funds to pressure a foreign government are the implications of a confrontation between Japan securities and banking industries <start> Anxiety is rising over recent government proposals to eventually lower the strict barriers that now separate -- and protect -- the two industries from each other <start> Both sides are jealously guarding their turf , and relations have been at a flashpoint for months <start> The banks badly want to break into all aspects of the securities business <start> Meanwhile , the securities companies -- most of them smaller than the banks -- are seeking access only to limited kinds of banking that would n't open them to the full brunt of competition from the banks <start> Nomura , the world 's biggest securities company largely by virtue of its protected home field , and Industrial Bank of Japan , Japan 's most innovative and aggressive bank in capital markets abroad , captain the opposing sides <start> And their suspicions of each other run deep <start> In the past year , both have tried to stretch the limits of their businesses <start> Nomura started a credit-card venture with American Express Co. that allowed cardholders to use their Nomura securities accounts like a bank account , attracting the wrath of banks <start> And Industrial Bank of Japan started up a London securities subsidiary that sells Japanese stocks to non-Japanese institutions overseas , a move that stirred the anger of the stock brokerage firms <start> The New Zealand bond issue simply has brought the two institutions face-to-face <start> <start> ITEL CORP. reported third-quarter earnings , which were mistakenly shown in the Quarterly Earnings Surprises table in yesterday 's edition to be lower than the average of analysts ' estimates <start> On a pretax basis , Itel 's third-quarter earnings of 30 cents a share were actually 7.14 % higher than the average of estimates <start> ( See : `` Quarterly Earnings

says <start> Perhaps <start> But for the next few months , these boys of summers long past are going to be reveling in an Indian summer of the soul <start> Now that the baseball season is officially over , you see , it 's time for a new season to begin <start> Today is the debut of the Senior Professional Baseball Association , a new eight-team pro sports circuit , modeled after the highly successful senior tennis and golf tours and complete with good salaries , a cable television contract and even expansion plans <start> One hundred and ninety two former greats , near greats , hardly knowns and unknowns begin a 72-game , three-month season in spring-training stadiums up and down Florida <start> For everyone involved , it 's one more swig of that elixir of youth , baseball <start> `` Someone always makes you quit , '' says legendary St. Louis Cardinals centerfielder Curt Flood , the league 's commissioner <start> `` You feel you want one more -- one more at-bat , one more hit , one more game <start> '' Until the baby-faced heroes of today reclaim these ballparks for spring training , there is one more <start> And not just for the players <start> It 's one more for the baseball-loving lawyers , accountants and real estate developers who ponied up about $ 1 million each for the chance to be an owner , to step into the shoes of a Gene Autry or have a beer with Rollie Fingers <start> `` Nothing can be better than this , '' says Don Sider , owner of the West Palm Beach Tropics <start> Early in the morning Mr. Sider , an estate lawyer , pores over last wills and testaments <start> Midmorning , he dons an orange-and-blue uniform and , for fun , may field a bunt from Dave Kingman <start> It 's one more , too , for the fans who dream of a season that never ends <start> `` I feel like a little kid , '' says a gleeful Alex de Castro , a car salesman , who has stopped by a workout of the Suns to slip six Campaneris cards to the Great Man Himself to be autographed <start> The league 's promoters hope retirees and tourists will join die-hard fans like Mr. de Castro and pack the stands to see the seniors <start> The league is the brainchild of Colorado real estate developer James Morley -- once a minor-leaguer himself -- who says he had the idea last January while lying on a beach in Australia <start> When he sent letters offering 1,250 retired major leaguers the chance of another season , 730 responded <start> Eventually , about 250 made the trip to Florida to compete for the available slots <start> ( Players have to be 35 or older , except for catchers , who are eligible at 32 because life behind the plate is so rough <start> ) For some players , the lure is money -- up to $ 15,000 a month <start> Others , just released from the majors , hope the senior league will be their bridge back into the big-time <start> But as they hurl fireballs that smolder rather than burn , and relive old duels in the sun , it 's clear that most are there to make their fans cheer again or recapture the camaraderie of seasons past or prove to themselves and their colleagues that they still have it -- or something close to it <start> `` My fastball is good <start> Real good , '' says 39-year-old Pete Broberg , working in the midday heat of the Tropics camp <start> Mr. Broberg , who started with the now-defunct Washington Senators , says that when he left baseball in 1978 , he `` never looked back <start> '' For a long time , he ignored baseball altogether , even the sports pages <start> Now Mr. Broberg , a lawyer , claims he 'd play for free <start> `` You ca n't give it up that easily , '' he says <start> `` I tried <start> '' The nagging memory of one afternoon fourteen years ago drove Jim Gideon , a lean 36-year-old righthander to take a four-month leave from selling insurance in Texas to try out for Mr. Weaver 's team <start> `` It does n't replace pitching in the majors , but it proves to me that I would have been able to play if I 'd stayed healthy , '' he says <start> Back in 1975 , late in the season , a then-21 Mr. Gideon made his only major league appearance , five and two-thirds innings for the Texas Rangers against the Chicago White Sox <start> He gave up seven hits , walked five and did n't get a decision <start> Arm troubles forced him back to the minors the next year <start> `` There 's a satisfaction in going against the rules , '' offers Will McEnaney , once a stopper with Cincinnati 's Big Red Machine <start> He means the rule that a player ca n't cut it after a certain age <start> These days he hustles to house-painting jobs in his Chevy pickup before and after training with the Tropics <start> While sipping a beer after practice , he vividly recounts getting the Red Sox 's Carl Yastrzemski to pop out to end the 1975 World Series , and repeating the feat against the Yankees ' Roy White in 1976 <start> Some of the game 's reigning philosophers dislike the idea of middle-aged men attempting a young man 's sport <start> `` I personally do n't enjoy seeing players who I remember vividly from their playing days running about and being gallant about their deficiencies , '' says Roger Angell , New Yorker magazine 's resident baseball sage <start> `` I feel people should be allowed to remember players as they were <start> '' Worse , says baseball author Lawrence Ritter , `` Someone will get a heart attack and that will be the end of the whole story <start> '' But the ballplayers disagree <start> Most are trim <start> Some have been training for months ; others only recently left active status <start> ( No one has worked out the players ' average age , but most appear to be in their late 30s <start> ) And there 's pride <start> `` I 'm not going to look stupid , '' vows former Pittsburgh Pirate second baseman Rennie Stennett , sweat dotting his brow as he prepares for some practice swings <start> `` It 's going to be a tough league , '' promises the 47-year-old Mr. Campaneris <start> `` There will be a lot of malice <start> '' Men who have played hard all their lives are n't about to change their habits , he says <start> Nonetheless
